# The syntax is trivial...
# You write each line as follow:
# denomination : amount : type

# First two fields must be an integers...
# denomination must be an integer, and can not be negative.
# amount must be an integer, and can not be negative.

# type must be either:
# w -> whole
# f -> fraction

# You can also replace ':' with any single-character as a token.
# But by doing so, you must give the new token as an argument.
# Some tokens are reserved. Thet are: 'w', 'f', '#' and the digits from 0 to 9

# Every line starts with '#' is a comment.
# Inline comments are the only supported comments.
# You can also have a valid expressions followed by a comment in a line.

# White spaces are ignored


# Actual info
1  : 74 : w  # 74
50 : 9  : f  # 4.5
25 : 27 : f  # 6.75
10 : 15 : f  # 1.5
5  : 15 : f  # 0.75
